text = "WEBVTT\n \n 1\n 00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:11.670\n Teun Hilte: Yes, it is.\n \n 2\n 00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.850\n Shankar Jagannathan: Correct me on this slide which I thought was very nice and concise is.\n \n 3\n 00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:37.800\n Shankar Jagannathan: It number one this thing keeps coming up right So if I think of what were trying to do from it as a pyramid from purpose, all the way down the products platforms and tools that we will build.\n \n 4\n 00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:47.940\n Shankar Jagannathan: And the effects of this what always comes up is transformational conversation we should always keep that as our non styles, are we really doing transformational conversations.\n \n 5\n 00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:57.000\n Shankar Jagannathan: The second thing that struck me, you know the next level, which would be useful, I think, as we get the product of these three macro characteristics.\n \n 6\n 00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:08.730\n Shankar Jagannathan: You know, are we adding focus to a conversation, are we bringing empathy out in their engagement, so there may be another way to think about as we think about what the product, and it should look like.\n \n 7\n 00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.900\n Shankar Jagannathan: And we adding richness, to the industry kind of areas so im going to keep in mind youre on later on.\n \n 8\n 00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.210\n Teun Hilte: One thing that I want, I just want to throw in the mix.\n \n 9\n 00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.940\n Teun Hilte: At this point.\n \n 10\n 00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:36.030\n Teun Hilte: I dont know if its right now is the right time to discuss it, but at least this sort of planted the seed in your mind something that chunk I mentioned yesterday that I think is a brilliant idea.\n \n 11\n 00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.330\n Teun Hilte: Whether.\n \n 12\n 00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.080\n Teun Hilte: We should consider doing some programming around a certain subject like, for example, the future of work thats been.\n \n 13\n 00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:57.660\n Teun Hilte: You know what well received, that is obviously very spur of the moment and whether it will help us kind of create a flywheel effect if we.\n \n 14\n 00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:08.040\n Teun Hilte: If we do that programming, regardless of whether some organizational client is paying us to do it, so that people can actually experience it and join it and.\n \n 15\n 00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.220\n Teun Hilte: And one more of it right.\n \n 16\n 00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:24.900\n Teun Hilte: I mean ive ive mentioned clubhouse before in these conversations I think clubhouse is an excellent example of a conversation platform that basically by provided by providing the platform that people are coming in.\n \n 17\n 00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:33.810\n Shared Studios: Can you like the most he explained what club house is they only know it, because it was hacked and all the data was leaked I dont know what it is.\n \n 18\n 00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.410\n Teun Hilte: yeah so clubhouse come as as the audio.\n \n 19\n 00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:51.960\n Teun Hilte: platform so its on your mobile smartphone you had to be very clever strategy, they that you had to be invited by somebody who was already a clubhouse you couldnt just join.\n \n 20\n 00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:02.010\n Teun Hilte: So you need an invitation from somewhere and everything rejoin everybody who joins gets limited number of invitations they can stand so once youre on the platform.\n \n 21\n 00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:12.930\n Teun Hilte: You basically you have these different rooms, that you can just enter and listen to and youre youre basically an audience Member in this room thats its audio only.\n \n 22\n 00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:26.250\n Teun Hilte: And you can you can be asked to come to the stage by the moderator and you can participate in the conversation, or you can just sit back and listen to it and its become very popular.\n \n 23\n 00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.200\n Teun Hilte: There is no far as im aware theres currently no like.\n \n 24\n 00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:43.920\n Teun Hilte: model behind it like a business model either making money, but a different position, the point is that its its invited and and its.\n \n 25\n 00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.750\n sort of.\n \n 26\n 00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.440\n Teun Hilte: enabled and inspired lots of people to just start conversations about.\n \n 27\n 00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.220\n Whatever topic.\n \n 28\n 00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.220\n Teun Hilte: anything from like the very silly and sort of trivial to quite serious conversations.\n \n 29\n 00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.100\n Teun Hilte: And I think what whats interesting about it is that.\n \n 30\n 00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.320\n Teun Hilte: The people are creating their own content right so by and there is a Community thats thats thats growing.\n \n 31\n 00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.150\n On the platform.\n \n 32\n 00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.370\n Teun Hilte: Are the shortcomings.\n \n 33\n 00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:25.470\n Shared Studios: are common people are coming people using it, because the data leak on this show powerful people like executives ex Presidents like.\n \n 34\n 00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.240\n Shared Studios: They have.\n \n 35\n 00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.540\n Shared Studios: very, very high profile people on the in the first month.\n \n 36\n 00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.900\n Shared Studios: So its on the masses right now right.\n \n 37\n 00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.430\n Teun Hilte: yeah I mean im.\n \n 38\n 00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.180\n Teun Hilte: im using it, I mean I dont im not actually using it actively but im on it, let me know a lot of people are on it.\n \n 39\n 00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.490\n Teun Hilte: And and one one final thing to think about is is also.\n \n 40\n 00:04:50.040 --> 00:05:02.220\n Teun Hilte: That, I think it could be a great source for this a separate conversation Brendan I think clubhouse could be a great source of moderators for us and people who are holding interesting conversations, but thats a separate concert.\n \n 41\n 00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:15.870\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): yeah can I can I return it to that first point, I think that what youre getting at toning in the first part of your your point is content and content management and the creation of unique content by us.\n \n 42\n 00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:33.780\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): That will be used as both a a way to you know communicate to the world what we do, but also, you know provide some some conversation that people could potentially buy into so thats something that were starting to work on go ahead im sorry.\n \n 43\n 00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:40.200\n Shankar Jagannathan: No, I was just going to help them along, I think that things I heard was from from dawn was about community.\n \n 44\n 00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:52.680\n Shankar Jagannathan: What does Community mean and what does it mean to engage the Community, so I think brandon youll talk to a bit more later, but lets also put a little spin on that, when we get to product, what does that mean to have an engaged community.\n \n 45\n 00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:01.470\n Shankar Jagannathan: The second is content is coming up a couple times right content will help us get more awareness more credibility, etc, so therefore.\n \n 46\n 00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:09.000\n Shankar Jagannathan: You know, obviously, the creation of content is in a different discussion and brandon maybe we can our programming workshop to.\n \n 47\n 00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:17.130\n Shankar Jagannathan: But the point being How do we make sure we curate and archive content right so that its its accessible.\n \n 48\n 00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:33.030\n Shankar Jagannathan: thats The second thing I do on, and the third is the things I underlined, we should just keep track of those when we get to product our we actually enabling those from a product platform perspective so good good good discussion okay lets move on im gonna do you have another slide.\n \n 49\n 00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.690\n Brent Marcus: That thats it for Mr.\n \n 50\n 00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.860\n Okay.\n \n 51\n 00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.660\n Shankar Jagannathan: Next.\n \n 52\n 00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:40.050\n Okay.\n \n 53\n 00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:57.570\n Brent Marcus: I think im next, so I think the next few slides maybe could have been in any order now, partly because of how this evolved but lets lets go to the next slide and see if we go down a way to call a rat hole, whatever the or if if its if its valuable.\n \n 54\n 00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.540\n Brent Marcus: But ill explain it lets see here.\n \n 55\n 00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.110\n Brent Marcus: back there buddy.\n \n 56\n 00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.110\n Brent Marcus: Oh hey something.\n \n 57\n 00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.340\n Okay.\n \n 58\n 00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.980\n Brent Marcus: So this slide.\n \n 59\n 00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.950\n Danara Sarioglu: You clear annotation sorry.\n \n 60\n 00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.660\n Shankar Jagannathan: Oh sorry but thats.\n \n 61\n 00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:35.850\n Brent Marcus: Okay thats where thats coming from thanks Okay, so let me explain how this slide got here, other than it was it was a bit of the kickoff before the kickoff now whats good is the first thing is transformation transformative conference cons conversations, but.\n \n 62\n 00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:47.700\n Brent Marcus: So this came from whats called business model canvas and the intent here is is again the how we connect the sides together and the product reports what the business is doing.\n \n 63\n 00:07:49.290 --> 00:08:01.140\n Brent Marcus: I made it simpler I dont know if anybodys seen seen that before ive used it a lot with new startups you have a new concept and youre trying to understand you know what direction to go and so forth, so.\n \n 64\n 00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:20.400\n Brent Marcus: This this represents what ive been saying, which is we like theres you know, and I think the prior slide is great, because it is and to tie it together and be more succinct focus like these are all almost all the different inputs that ive kind of heard over the last month.\n \n 65\n 00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.270\n Brent Marcus: But but lets walk through it and then.\n \n 66\n 00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:34.380\n Brent Marcus: This decide to continue or jump in or something missing or come back to it later, but this is what content here is to tie it to.\n \n 67\n 00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:46.170\n Brent Marcus: heres an example so assets so as we just said were were experts were good at transformative conference conversations thats an asset, how do we capitalize on that right.\n \n 68\n 00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.150\n Brent Marcus: Sorry.\n \n 69\n 00:08:51.630 --> 00:09:08.100\n Brent Marcus: Okay, well, we have to go after a segment, so you know, one of the talks is companies are doing diversity, training, so how can we facilitate you know were going to take that asset were going to go and look at the diversity market and were going to have prot you know product ties.\n \n 70\n 00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.980\n Brent Marcus: Product ties that conversation into the product on the right side.\n \n 71\n 00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.680\n Brent Marcus: conversation I had with shankar on this was.\n \n 72\n 00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:32.880\n Brent Marcus: Not just that but look at profit margin so, for instance, when we talk about analytics and, particularly, we want to kind of focus, I feel like the first focus on analytics as we call it.\n \n 73\n 00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:39.420\n Brent Marcus: The engagement index that if thats the part about quantifying how good of a conversation, it is.\n \n 74\n 00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:52.560\n Brent Marcus: That part once we develop it is is good to go like that can be copied right, whereas other of these products still may have a big Labor component, or something like that or or I mean we you know.\n \n 75\n 00:09:53.820 --> 00:10:01.140\n Brent Marcus: Something we talked weve talked about that we havent yet is competition, we know that basically everything we list is pretty competitive.\n \n 76\n 00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:09.960\n Brent Marcus: Actually thats why I wrote at the at the bottom, that we have a cup of proprietary things right that other other people do not have.\n \n 77\n 00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:24.660\n Brent Marcus: Well thats thats what this is about me pause there for a second I can kind of walk through and just what peoples thoughts are and I havent part of it, too, is I havent participated in you know, the other side is much on the marketing and.\n \n 78\n 00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.860\n Brent Marcus: No hot takes OK.\n \n 79\n 00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:45.090\n Brent Marcus: So the things that I think we have that we can capitalize on and again trying to these arent necessary in order, but just to be aware of that we can.\n \n 80\n 00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.580\n Brent Marcus: Take now and turn into product or leverage into product.\n \n 81\n 00:10:51.630 --> 00:11:05.580\n Brent Marcus: conversations the immersive experiences off see programming curation speaker community which we talked about so that was a wrinkle I think and Tony was talking, we got into it was, we also have this extended network of.\n \n 82\n 00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:21.150\n Brent Marcus: That we can leverage right for these conversations dissipate in whatever our Community is maybe set that up bring them in the clubhouse analytics, of course, which weve kind of just started on this last few weeks, last month.\n \n 83\n 00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.770\n Brent Marcus: also have the portals network and team.\n \n 84\n 00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:32.160\n Brent Marcus: or ego is here, obviously a mark did a lot of work journeys and team, I mean you know.\n \n 85\n 00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:37.950\n Brent Marcus: dinara in a cm Ahmed do the work and put on the right direction.\n \n 86\n 00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.110\n Brent Marcus: premium production, you know what Tony Tony brought to the table.\n \n 87\n 00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.430\n Brent Marcus: First partners that comes up a lot and brand.\n \n 88\n 00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.690\n Brent Marcus: And I wanted to put brand there because.\n \n 89\n 00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.660\n Brent Marcus: A lot of I mean this is, you know.\n \n 90\n 00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:03.660\n Brent Marcus: Maybe out of my scope but you know what is the brand obviously the last slide really tries, the last couple of slides talks about what were about.\n \n 91\n 00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:17.220\n Brent Marcus: So so even though theres a case of you, what do we want to put our name on right so so maybe some of these dont make sense, because you know theyre not part of that global conversation.\n \n 92\n 00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.030\n Brent Marcus: Across cultural training and then those kind of things.\n \n 93\n 00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:26.490\n Brent Marcus: But if weve measured it, but obviously actually a friend of mine.\n \n 94\n 00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:36.210\n Brent Marcus: Was you know someone that youve worked with your work with he knew exactly what you know what the portals is and so forth, so there certainly is.\n \n 95\n 00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:45.000\n Brent Marcus: Some recognition, but also, you know, a project on on sending data and being consistent with as value as a value driver.\n \n 96\n 00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:47.970\n Brent Marcus: OK, so the segments.\n \n 97\n 00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:50.460\n Shankar Jagannathan: there.\n \n 98\n 00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:52.650\n Shankar Jagannathan: Maybe just to get some.\n \n 99\n 00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:54.690\n Shankar Jagannathan: Some reaction.\n \n 100\n 00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:03.030\n Shankar Jagannathan: Any thoughts on the assets column that brendas put down anything missing or you would not treat as a asset, at this point.\n \n 101\n 00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.420\n Shankar Jagannathan: Just focusing on the assets column for now.\n \n 102\n 00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:19.950\n Shankar Jagannathan: im not sure transformative conversations is an asset for myself, maybe we need some the ability to host and moderator conversation is the acid.\n \n 103\n 00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:29.340\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): I dont know I guess I I see, I see that as an APP that and then I just think that.\n \n 104\n 00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.840\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): And I dont know if this is important or not, but I I see.\n \n 105\n 00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:49.590\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): The portals networking team, the journeys and team and the speaker Community all being part of the same asset which is our our global community, and I think we need to start thinking of all of those different groups as a single group.\n \n 106\n 00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:55.260\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): Because, ultimately, those speakers will help us find more speakers and will eventually take the role of the curator.\n \n 107\n 00:13:55.950 --> 00:14:01.110\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): Because well be well have a Community network thats essentially providing us with more Community guests.\n \n 108\n 00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:13.020\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): And our curators then focus on the ground, like, I think that we need to really start treating not old thing is that, as a as a single Community, which is an HR is that an enormous asset.\n \n 109\n 00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:13.530\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): To oh.\n \n 110\n 00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:24.450\n Shankar Jagannathan: What can I push back and im just which ones are you are you loving together, because the portals network is a physical network that can be decoupled from a speaker Community right.\n \n 111\n 00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:33.420\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): yeah thats thats fair, I guess, I just see that there needs to be a space for all of those folks to interact outside of the portal.\n \n 112\n 00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.020\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): And so they become part of you know.\n \n 113\n 00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.630\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): theyre a part of the Community.\n \n 114\n 00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:42.900\n Shankar Jagannathan: So we dont.\n \n 115\n 00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:44.430\n Shankar Jagannathan: know.\n \n 116\n 00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:58.830\n Danara Sarioglu: yeah I was just trying to understand as well, so you see you saying that we have our global community, but then we have separate segments inside there, like a secondary worth, but we have separate roles in that.\n \n 117\n 00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:09.030\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): yeah I think thats right like if you imagine it by I mean I dont know from the product side what this will eventually look like, but my initial imagining of it is something like.\n \n 118\n 00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:21.510\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): You know its not really but slack you know, there are different channels contributors are part of different channels organized around global topics or issues that they are involved in are interested in, or there you know segmented off.\n \n 119\n 00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:33.990\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): theres that theres you know Community engagement curators who are constantly engaging their local communities, for both portal guests and to bring other people into the Community network.\n \n 120\n 00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:51.330\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): And I think all of those and then each guests that we bring in becomes a flywheel effect and that they start introducing us to new guests by inviting people into this larger community, and I think eventually we we dont have to rely so heavily on our our local curators on the ground.\n \n 121\n 00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:59.940\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): To be finding guest, I think our desktop find gaps and we continue to build the Community like that.\n \n 122\n 00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.940\n Shankar Jagannathan: yeah so the speaker Community bullet.\n \n 123\n 00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:19.740\n Shankar Jagannathan: lines of what youre saying its a big asset to us because the bigger we havent the better becomes the bigger it becomes right its a flywheel effect that others will have difficulty scaling up even if its a new player on lock.\n \n 124\n 00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.210\n Shankar Jagannathan: yeah so that for sure is a key asset.\n \n 125\n 00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:38.430\n Brent Marcus: I think the one thing that comes up here come up here is how does this connect you know we talked about self service if customers are going to find us independently and come on and.\n \n 126\n 00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:49.410\n Brent Marcus: run their own programming and so forth, you know so forth, is if thats the part I mean I can I envision I can see where they can tap into the speakers lets say or or do that but I.\n \n 127\n 00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:55.050\n Brent Marcus: Think when we talked about that theres some of this may get you know left off.\n \n 128\n 00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.450\n Brent Marcus: So I kind of throw that out there.\n \n 129\n 00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:18.000\n Shankar Jagannathan: Okay, can I be provocative just to have a point of discussion so for each of these columns would we be able to vote on the top lets say top two I dont even wanting expanded the three top two acid segments and value prop items, just so we have a sense of how aligned, we are.\n \n 130\n 00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.980\n Brent Marcus: me walk through each person here and have them vote or.\n \n 131\n 00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:34.590\n Shankar Jagannathan: yeah very quickly and maybe you can get into slide edit mode and put some hash marks or something brand new.\n \n 132\n 00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:42.420\n hey.\n \n 133\n 00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.840\n Teun Hilte: We can only choose to.\n \n 134\n 00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.330\n Shankar Jagannathan: Go to for now, just to force us to be.\n \n 135\n 00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.770\n Danara Sarioglu: I can go.\n \n 136\n 00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:14.910\n Danara Sarioglu: Talks and purpose that weve talked about I dont know if we decided actually right now, if were making the transformative transformative conversations and as it or as shankar said, the ability to host a conversation but.\n \n 137\n 00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.150\n Danara Sarioglu: Also, like that as one.\n \n 138\n 00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.050\n Danara Sarioglu: And the.\n \n 139\n 00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:30.060\n Danara Sarioglu: global community as to because those two will bring the content that diversity, the.\n \n 140\n 00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:32.670\n Danara Sarioglu: And then we can build on top of those.\n \n 141\n 00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.250\n Shankar Jagannathan: Okay next.\n \n 142\n 00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:38.730\n Danara Sarioglu: Six person.\n \n 143\n 00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.380\n Shankar Jagannathan: yeah you wanted and making the.\n \n 144\n 00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:45.480\n Shankar Jagannathan: movie so.\n \n 145\n 00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.060\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): ill go.\n \n 146\n 00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:52.500\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): I think global community is number one.\n \n 147\n 00:18:53.640 --> 00:19:05.910\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): im at theres so many of these that I see wrapped up into one, so this is more challenging but I ill take programming and curation is do because to me that include the ability to put together transformative conversation.\n \n 148\n 00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:10.950\n Shankar Jagannathan: start.\n \n 149\n 00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:19.350\n Shankar Jagannathan: Looking at it, as the current state of the land or even in the future we extrapolate just to make sure were on the same page.\n \n 150\n 00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.330\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): For me its future.\n \n 151\n 00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:22.860\n Shankar Jagannathan: Its future okay.\n \n 152\n 00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:24.390\n Shankar Jagannathan: yeah okay.\n \n 153\n 00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:27.630\n Shankar Jagannathan: All right.\n \n 154\n 00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.790\n Teun Hilte: me I think its.\n \n 155\n 00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.000\n Teun Hilte: The immersive experience.\n \n 156\n 00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:45.300\n Teun Hilte: its what makes portals memorable for people who has done.\n \n 157\n 00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.710\n Teun Hilte: And from it, and secondly programming, I think.\n \n 158\n 00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.320\n Teun Hilte: You know, good programming, I think.\n \n 159\n 00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.910\n Teun Hilte: automatically sparks transformative conversation.\n \n 160\n 00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.220\n Teun Hilte: programming.\n \n 161\n 00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.110\n Shankar Jagannathan: whos next so yeah.\n \n 162\n 00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.190\n Shankar Jagannathan: See im still there.\n \n 163\n 00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:17.790\n Siam Mridha: yeah im.\n \n 164\n 00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:19.350\n Shankar Jagannathan: thinking.\n \n 165\n 00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:27.330\n Siam Mridha: Okay thats trying to unmute myself so just just one question that global speaker community that would be so soothing like.\n \n 166\n 00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:29.940\n Siam Mridha: To create your own content.\n \n 167\n 00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.200\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): It could go either way right.\n \n 168\n 00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.370\n Siam Mridha: So you know our book for that and.\n \n 169\n 00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:47.820\n Siam Mridha: Simply because that would help us a lot and other can have more other clients who can come in and create their own content.\n \n 170\n 00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:55.530\n Siam Mridha: And the other one is programming which.\n \n 171\n 00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:57.510\n Shankar Jagannathan: You.\n \n 172\n 00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:02.970\n Shankar Jagannathan: There we go.\n \n 173\n 00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:14.970\n Shared Studios: For me its immersive experiences and now analytics analytics are going to play a huge part and directions, but I dont know late expert just another company.\n \n 174\n 00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:16.440\n Mr.\n \n 175\n 00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.120\n Amar Bakshi: im.\n \n 176\n 00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:25.020\n Amar Bakshi: Only two thats the challenge.\n \n 177\n 00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:25.530\n For me.\n \n 178\n 00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.630\n Shankar Jagannathan: That was deliberate.\n \n 179\n 00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:40.260\n Amar Bakshi: yeah well, I think I I appreciate whatever you got Rodrigo saying, but I, and I definitely put up there, but I would say the speaker community and the moderation curation.\n \n 180\n 00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:44.730\n Shankar Jagannathan: Right.\n \n 181\n 00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.050\n Shankar Jagannathan: And my last.\n \n 182\n 00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.550\n Amar Bakshi: with everything else certain that.\n \n 183\n 00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:51.570\n Shankar Jagannathan: Granted, you.\n \n 184\n 00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:52.350\n Teun Hilte: Last.\n \n 185\n 00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.130\n Teun Hilte: Last, but not.\n \n 186\n 00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:55.980\n Brent Marcus: least.\n \n 187\n 00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:10.230\n Brent Marcus: Okay, so so actually to solve a Mars problem I can cheat with brands, like, I feel, like everything were discussing and obviously all the tick marks like thats what shared studios is about right and again im not an expert in this, but.\n \n 188\n 00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:12.360\n Brent Marcus: A brand.\n \n 189\n 00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:25.260\n Brent Marcus: yeah so that is the permeate right so so I like I like the end thats what drew us here right, I mean I remember vic speech from last meetings right, why are we here.\n \n 190\n 00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.440\n Brent Marcus: To I mean.\n \n 191\n 00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:35.070\n Brent Marcus: I actually I mean I dont id love to see this, I feel like because im my.\n \n 192\n 00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.230\n Brent Marcus: person.\n \n 193\n 00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:44.430\n Brent Marcus: im gonna go with the programming, I mean, I think that that looks like a very unique value.\n \n 194\n 00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:48.420\n Brent Marcus: Even though we want to tie it over to the you know.\n \n 195\n 00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:52.440\n Brent Marcus: well.\n \n 196\n 00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:55.440\n Brent Marcus: Very good.\n \n 197\n 00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:14.250\n Shankar Jagannathan: Last, and I will do the same carrier does Brenton not as experienced or savvy as some of you guys so David bit of salt I would definitely and im ignoring documentary conversation, because I think thats a bit of a roll up its not on top of.\n \n 198\n 00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:17.040\n Danara Sarioglu: That Yes, that was like cheating.\n \n 199\n 00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.170\n Shankar Jagannathan: yeah I do, and I agree with you.\n \n 200\n 00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.860\n Shankar Jagannathan: But I will put programming curation will be our future.\n \n 201\n 00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:31.620\n Shankar Jagannathan: And one im with Rodrigo and analytics to play a big role in how we demonstrate to the Lord we had translated.\n \n 202\n 00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.290\n Shankar Jagannathan: and distinct so.\n \n 203\n 00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:38.010\n Shankar Jagannathan: Good moving on.\n \n 204\n 00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.970\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): thats been quite difficult for me.\n \n 205\n 00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:54.000\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): I mean here whats challenging for this is, I would say, global conversation.\n \n 206\n 00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:57.420\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): I dont know if I would consider that a segment.\n \n 207\n 00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:04.590\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): That is encompassed by all of the stuff thats below it, except for maybe live event.\n \n 208\n 00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:08.910\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): Does that resonate with anyone.\n \n 209\n 00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:09.660\n yeah.\n \n 210\n 00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:13.110\n Brent Marcus: I think I kind of realized that.\n \n 211\n 00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:21.000\n Shankar Jagannathan: Some of the categories for people as we go along right maybe live events as independent I think people would agree.\n \n 212\n 00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.940\n Brent Marcus: I say I once again.\n \n 213\n 00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:29.670\n Shankar Jagannathan: Just blown some of the categories that are independent versus dependent so.\n \n 214\n 00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.170\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): And I would say, you know corporate learning.\n \n 215\n 00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:42.270\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): Within that is leadership training diversity equity inclusion I think thats all part of an enterprise segment im.\n \n 216\n 00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:45.690\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): Talking about that right, but.\n \n 217\n 00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:49.980\n Brent Marcus: yeah yeah I was a mess up the slides.\n \n 218\n 00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:55.920\n Brent Marcus: With the I dont know about entrepreneurship, I suppose that could be separate from.\n \n 219\n 00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.890\n Brent Marcus: yeah I mean some of these, obviously, if something.\n \n 220\n 00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:07.320\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): yeah for me ill do number one is corporate learning.\n \n 221\n 00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:23.010\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): go where the money is and number two I think is study study abroad education segment arm, so I might add here arts and cultural institutions, but that would be a three.\n \n 222\n 00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.140\n Danara Sarioglu: I gonna second friend and.\n \n 223\n 00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:29.790\n Just.\n \n 224\n 00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:34.830\n Shankar Jagannathan: Alright lets make it a speed around.\n \n 225\n 00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.380\n Shankar Jagannathan: whos next dont.\n \n 226\n 00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:41.670\n Teun Hilte: Give me one more minute.\n \n 227\n 00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:45.030\n Shankar Jagannathan: whos ready.\n \n 228\n 00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.610\n Shankar Jagannathan: To.\n \n 229\n 00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.870\n Shared Studios: discuss completely outside of my expertise I.\n \n 230\n 00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:54.240\n Shankar Jagannathan: You know I do more thats okay.\n \n 231\n 00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.830\n Shared Studios: I would say, live events definitely.\n \n 232\n 00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.010\n Shared Studios: and\n \n 233\n 00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:09.990\n Shared Studios: Both corporate and study abroad are growing like crazy things with corporate moneys good.\n \n 234\n 00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:22.890\n Teun Hilte: Can I just saw somebody talking specifically about the virtual but for more or including portal as well, because I think they have slightly different.\n \n 235\n 00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:24.990\n Teun Hilte: segments.\n \n 236\n 00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:33.300\n Brent Marcus: To mention dependent and independent and then thats What if were targeting a segment, we need to figure out what the product.\n \n 237\n 00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.330\n Brent Marcus: or services for that right.\n \n 238\n 00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:48.840\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): I think I think thats all right, but I push back on that a little bit um I think that the portal and the platform for both corporate learning and for education.\n \n 239\n 00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:58.800\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): I think theres a value prop for both of those platform if our initial value prop is the conversations and the Community.\n \n 240\n 00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:06.510\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): I think it should ultimately and feel free to push back on this, but if we start from that which is where im starting from.\n \n 241\n 00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:21.360\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): Then the platform is secondary to meeting the value prop is how you want to meet that value prop as opposed to it, is the value prop and have you say something like tone immersive experience, and I think portal becomes the value prop so.\n \n 242\n 00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:29.400\n Shankar Jagannathan: yeah thats exactly right, so I think its just.\n \n 243\n 00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:31.740\n Shankar Jagannathan: The gut instinct of where you think the.\n \n 244\n 00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.890\n Shankar Jagannathan: dollars are that we can address critically the right to play.\n \n 245\n 00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:41.550\n Teun Hilte: yeah okay well ill also say corporate learning.\n \n 246\n 00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:45.180\n Teun Hilte: and education.\n \n 247\n 00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.420\n Shankar Jagannathan: Okay, Sam.\n \n 248\n 00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.800\n Siam Mridha: Global conversation on.\n \n 249\n 00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:06.480\n Shankar Jagannathan: Mr.\n \n 250\n 00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.650\n Amar Bakshi: yeah I think corporations and education learning.\n \n 251\n 00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.240\n Shankar Jagannathan: Right, did you go.\n \n 252\n 00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.850\n Brent Marcus: No, but im going to throw a wrinkle not a wrinkle but.\n \n 253\n 00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:40.350\n Brent Marcus: im going to ask us to drill down more so, I mean, even though this super crowded, I mean thats obviously a hot spaces, the diversity and I dont know once we get out there, you know what the competition is like right or offering would would.\n \n 254\n 00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.870\n Brent Marcus: But recently im actually im going to vote down here to.\n \n 255\n 00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:51.240\n Brent Marcus: This, I guess, like, I guess, to really cause be a contrarian but.\n \n 256\n 00:28:52.440 --> 00:29:01.140\n Brent Marcus: Because, as we started looking at the links Inc project, you know theyre they align with our brand right there into the corporate the goal sorry.\n \n 257\n 00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:14.370\n Brent Marcus: Cross cultural ISM right and Tom correct me if im wrong because I was this meeting tomorrow to talk to you to get more up to speed, but I found that very interesting with the with that aspect of fundraising.\n \n 258\n 00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.720\n Brent Marcus: helping them with fundraising could event I dont know if it would lead to.\n \n 259\n 00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:28.260\n Brent Marcus: The cross selling to right so look were you know heres heres somebody we want to work with their they they think like they they match our brand.\n \n 260\n 00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:36.570\n Brent Marcus: And you know we can we can break and enter into our world with this fundraising product.\n \n 261\n 00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:48.570\n Brent Marcus: Oh, by the way, maybe theyll need some programming later, but I just throw that out there just because ive thought about it recently I mean im in agreement, I think thats my main thing is good broke down.\n \n 262\n 00:29:49.770 --> 00:30:02.250\n Shankar Jagannathan: I think im last ill just go down the middle and corporate learning and education we make choices, too, so I think in showing that middle column, we are a little more aligned on.\n \n 263\n 00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:06.570\n Shankar Jagannathan: On the main segments thats attractive to us.\n \n 264\n 00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:10.650\n Shankar Jagannathan: Okay, I think we can skip the last column, unless you guys.\n \n 265\n 00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.890\n Danara Sarioglu: love the section eight, so you can say something.\n \n 266\n 00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:27.660\n Danara Sarioglu: Like going from first slides until here, it seems like the one thing that keeps coming up is the Community and learning so its kind of like when Tony asked about what is Community me to define that at least right now, I just wanted to catch that thought.\n \n 267\n 00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:37.020\n Danara Sarioglu: Like thought that I had its girls oriented community that come together to.\n \n 268\n 00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:43.080\n Danara Sarioglu: I didnt know you guys can say better again, so I think those are the words that.\n \n 269\n 00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:45.090\n Danara Sarioglu: have been thinking.\n \n 270\n 00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.530\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): I just wanted to yeah ill just.\n \n 271\n 00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:47.040\n Danara Sarioglu: ill just.\n \n 272\n 00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:49.920\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): ECHO that dinner and youll hear me at going on.\n \n 273\n 00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:56.070\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): In a later slide that the Community is all about a place to showcase a place to learn and a place to play.\n \n 274\n 00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:58.830\n Shankar Jagannathan: Brendan you want to use.\n \n 275\n 00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:01.350\n Shankar Jagannathan: The right time.\n \n 276\n 00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:08.490\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): yeah, I think, because my flight could be broken up a few different places, so if you just want to go there friends um.\n \n 277\n 00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:15.930\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): I I specifically think that when we get to the idea of community.\n \n 278\n 00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:27.720\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): That it needs to be a space for an opportunity for contributors and other folks in our Community, I think we do need to following tone kind of decide for for the Members of this Community.\n \n 279\n 00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:42.690\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): to interact with one another and network and exchange ideas to showcase their own work through our transformative conversation on and to play and by play I just mean a place for them to have social interaction as well.\n \n 280\n 00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:53.040\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): And, and so I think the two key ones here are share opportunities to join our conversation to showcase their work, but I think that.\n \n 281\n 00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:57.810\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): That sharing also needs to include a space for them to network with one another and.\n \n 282\n 00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:03.270\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): collaborate outside of the work that we do I think thats how we create a value prop for them.\n \n 283\n 00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:11.880\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): And it needs to be a space where they can learn from this other community, and I think all of that, then we welcome partners into that community.\n \n 284\n 00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:25.500\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): By providing them the opportunity to engage this global community of really great people across a variety of different topics to be able to provide opportunities for them to showcase their work to learn from them, etc.\n \n 285\n 00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:34.800\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): So theres a number of features that I think needs to be part of this Community I dont necessarily want to drill down into that specific features, but.\n \n 286\n 00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:48.300\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): You know, we, I think that this the Community piece in terms of how, in terms of how it relates to product is our platform essentially become a Community space.\n \n 287\n 00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:59.370\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): And we enable our Community members, through our video conferencing software journeys or through portal immersive interactions in the portal to share to learn into play.\n \n 288\n 00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:05.940\n Danara Sarioglu: yeah.\n \n 289\n 00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:09.990\n Brent Marcus: thats thats thats great.\n \n 290\n 00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:22.560\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): I mean that feeds into content repository to, but I think we can we can kind of engage that maybe.\n \n 291\n 00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:30.240\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): A little bit later, but thats a space for our partners that have had conversations available to folks.\n \n 292\n 00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:36.000\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): You know, I think it should all feel, I think we need to get the Community piece right first and then determine.\n \n 293\n 00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:51.540\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): What content lives it within that Community versus what is and how to people, you know is some content free and people can can access it and then its some of it part of a subscription where our partners and subscribe to have access to you know hidden content.\n \n 294\n 00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.140\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): But I think we can go back to Chicago.\n \n 295\n 00:33:58.170 --> 00:33:59.430\n yeah like we can move back.\n \n 296\n 00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:17.010\n Danara Sarioglu: Sorry, I just wanted to also like kind of point out like I love that you have like your chair learn play, but in the end it feels like the whole purpose is to educate and to increase our or decrease or medical sharp oh my gosh.\n \n 297\n 00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:30.810\n Danara Sarioglu: Just remove our edges, as people right if thats the right wording, so I think like the sharing learning of playing are the tools, but the actual purpose of that communities to grow together or you know what I mean theres.\n \n 298\n 00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:38.670\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): yeah I think thats right dinner, I think the learning, I think the learning is full important from a potential partner standpoint.\n \n 299\n 00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:49.770\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): They can learn through conversations we host on you know, diversity and inclusion or or leadership, but its also a place for the Community itself to learn from one another.\n \n 300\n 00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:58.380\n Shankar Jagannathan: It can I just add a comment, this is great discussion, but when we talk about Community programming content.\n \n 301\n 00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:04.560\n Shankar Jagannathan: Can we make sure we do it in the context of product strategy because.\n \n 302\n 00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:21.210\n Shankar Jagannathan: How community should be fun to read it is more of a programming workshop discussion and guys, we can have that one too, if you guys think its useful in two weeks or so, but right now lets keep the focus on the bottom of the pyramid what does that mean so.\n \n 303\n 00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:34.530\n Danara Sarioglu: yeah and, for me, like the way you talk about the education part that actually kind of with informed the product itself with informed technology what we would need to build and focus the tools on.\n \n 304\n 00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:38.400\n Shankar Jagannathan: yeah so lets go on that at the proper time thats exactly right.\n \n 305\n 00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:46.140\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): yeah I mean, for me it is directly into product, what is the what is the product were building for to enable these things happen.\n \n 306\n 00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:48.330\n Shankar Jagannathan: Right.\n \n 307\n 00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:52.230\n Brent Marcus: And then I guess the piggyback yeah I mean each.\n \n 308\n 00:35:53.430 --> 00:36:04.530\n Brent Marcus: And then, why not well get to it in this call, but you know were we spin up were into this prototyping now, so you know the ideas as to when we focus in on one segment of the product.\n \n 309\n 00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:14.820\n Brent Marcus: We do do all that depth in and kick the tires on that I want to take another to our meeting, but you know that that will be part of it is that process.\n \n 310\n 00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.960\n Brent Marcus: hey lets go back well.\n \n 311\n 00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:23.730\n Teun Hilte: I think whats whats.\n \n 312\n 00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:28.620\n Teun Hilte: useful to think about in relation.\n \n 313\n 00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:45.300\n Teun Hilte: to sort of put ourselves back to that discussion again is to think about like whats the whats the real life opportunity out there and how, how would how might that might product fit so, for example, were talking to New York schools and potentially a very big clients and im.\n \n 314\n 00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.600\n Teun Hilte: I think you guys have already had a call, so we might have.\n \n 315\n 00:36:49.650 --> 00:37:06.780\n Teun Hilte: We might have you know some some feedback on that already but lets imagine you have like a school system like New York schools, which is, which covers a lot of different schools that have a need for education and tools to help educate the students, if you imagine that to be like a.\n \n 316\n 00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:08.760\n Teun Hilte: A European.\n \n 317\n 00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:15.360\n Teun Hilte: A table with the European plug and then we have our our Community our.\n \n 318\n 00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.640\n Teun Hilte: global community of.\n \n 319\n 00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.840\n Teun Hilte: Experts and contributors.\n \n 320\n 00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:33.420\n Teun Hilte: Which is a foreign plug like, how do we form the the adapter that basically plugs those two elements together that connects them So how do we.\n \n 321\n 00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:51.090\n Teun Hilte: How do we serve up our Community to the New York schools in this particular case, in order to serve their needs and to utilize our our network like, how does the product, what does the product needs to look like what it took for us to be able to serve them our.\n \n 322\n 00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:52.650\n Teun Hilte: Network.\n \n 323\n 00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:54.540\n Danara Sarioglu: going to quickly.\n \n 324\n 00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:55.860\n And seamlessly.\n \n 325\n 00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:06.540\n Danara Sarioglu: So I want to quickly, just to clarify when we say community are we saying the Community that are, it also includes the participants or was a Community its only the experts, I think thats where.\n \n 326\n 00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:08.190\n Danara Sarioglu: bit.\n \n 327\n 00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:22.890\n Teun Hilte: Well, I mean thats two separate were talking about it in two separate ways of thing but its a good point I think the one way, is that we are talking about our Community, which is a community of speakers, you know, the participants contributors.\n \n 328\n 00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:25.260\n Teun Hilte: thats one sort of.\n \n 329\n 00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:33.060\n Teun Hilte: Existing Community I think when were talking about the wider community that doesnt currently exist because we dont have.\n \n 330\n 00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:45.630\n Teun Hilte: We dont have anywhere, for them to login or to sort of be right, there is no, there is no place for the wider community currently thats what we need to create if we decide that its.\n \n 331\n 00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:47.160\n Danara Sarioglu: So the students who for.\n \n 332\n 00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:49.590\n Danara Sarioglu: Those would be our wider community right.\n \n 333\n 00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:51.180\n Danara Sarioglu: yeah.\n \n 334\n 00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.880\n Teun Hilte: They would become part of the Community by joining.\n \n 335\n 00:38:55.500 --> 00:39:05.700\n Danara Sarioglu: So we create the keywords and make sure that we always use them in the future, I think brands, you also were talking about how confusing it is like the wordings for things that we have.\n \n 336\n 00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.160\n Brent Marcus: yeah actually.\n \n 337\n 00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:10.050\n Teun Hilte: I think thats a very good point.\n \n 338\n 00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:24.480\n Shankar Jagannathan: We have to be very sure we do have some of these things, by the way, that bibliography or definitions or taxonomy is important, so we should codify as we go along.\n \n 339\n 00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:32.340\n Shankar Jagannathan: But when we say community and thing we make sure we have a mental model of what that is anemic and im a big fan of analogies.\n \n 340\n 00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:52.350\n Shankar Jagannathan: You know im a big skeptic of somebody needs to invent something completely brand new im sure its anything we think of as a model exists in some of the space we just dont know right and so when we say Community lets take netflix the communities, all the viewers, I suspect right.\n \n 341\n 00:39:53.670 --> 00:40:00.660\n Shankar Jagannathan: But other viewers all connected does network care whether all the viewers are connected as a Community, I just wanted to challenge no theyre.\n \n 342\n 00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:07.890\n Shankar Jagannathan: Not right exactly so I just want to challenge ourselves to make sure we say community we dont make it so broad that theres no.\n \n 343\n 00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:18.090\n Shankar Jagannathan: connection between them like Why am I going and logging into platform every morning in chance to do is to show im alive and part of the Community right now has to be a connection.\n \n 344\n 00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:21.510\n Teun Hilte: well.\n \n 345\n 00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:23.580\n Teun Hilte: The connection with the.\n \n 346\n 00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:28.680\n Teun Hilte: There are there would be a need for that connection I guess or demand for it if.\n \n 347\n 00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:32.700\n Teun Hilte: If there is content that they can share, and there are.\n \n 348\n 00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:37.470\n Teun Hilte: People that they leave right thats the only reason why they would connect.\n \n 349\n 00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:42.690\n Teun Hilte: Because yeah youre right if people want to connect that can do that on Facebook or.\n \n 350\n 00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:45.780\n Teun Hilte: instagram or Twitter or whatever, but thats.\n \n 351\n 00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:52.320\n Teun Hilte: thats not were talking about I guess were talking about people connecting over.\n \n 352\n 00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:59.220\n Teun Hilte: As a result of and or over the content and the programming, that we will survive.\n \n 353\n 00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:12.780\n Shankar Jagannathan: So, at the risk of inventing something new, but it looks like content spaces, is where they would come to because theres some content to share Lon play to use random words.\n \n 354\n 00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:16.560\n Danara Sarioglu: So, can you say its a content community.\n \n 355\n 00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.390\n Danara Sarioglu: thats the word.\n \n 356\n 00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.030\n Danara Sarioglu: participants.\n \n 357\n 00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:26.730\n I.\n \n 358\n 00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.280\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): mean I think its also.\n \n 359\n 00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:41.520\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): yeah content Community content and speaker Community right because the speakers, sometimes become the content that people want to interact with or or.\n \n 360\n 00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.000\n Amar Bakshi: and not every Member of this community is.\n \n 361\n 00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:11.340\n Amar Bakshi: Equal, in the sense that every Facebook member is you know we have presenters ambassadors, who we say are trained and capable of leading conversations are participating in them as featured but not any student is that.\n \n 362\n 00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:16.170\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): I think thats right.\n \n 363\n 00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:26.160\n Danara Sarioglu: So we have consuming consumers as Community basically The consequence is the Creator.\n \n 364\n 00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:28.950\n Danara Sarioglu: We dont which.\n \n 365\n 00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:33.870\n Shankar Jagannathan: I think.\n \n 366\n 00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:39.090\n Shankar Jagannathan: That Community engagement and then a stumbling into much unless.\n \n 367\n 00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.440\n Teun Hilte: What I do want to ask is you know what.\n \n 368\n 00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:47.640\n Teun Hilte: What do, what do we expect people to really.\n \n 369\n 00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.940\n Teun Hilte: Do like it mean do we.\n \n 370\n 00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:55.920\n Teun Hilte: Once once somebody has lets say somebody joins a conversation.\n \n 371\n 00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:02.580\n Teun Hilte: And they sign up and they register and they will become part of our Community, because theyre registered.\n \n 372\n 00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:17.310\n Teun Hilte: What do we expect them to do like what do we expect theyre going to reach out to one of the speakers have a conversation that theyve been part of and said hey I love what youre doing Keep it up or.\n \n 373\n 00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:32.760\n Teun Hilte: ask them questions or you know or or is that not realistic, is that know is there is that I mean it does that need exists from the people that are going to form part of our Community, or is it going to be or is that a sort of a bit of a pipe dream.\n \n 374\n 00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:33.930\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): I mean.\n \n 375\n 00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:34.590\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): We could also.\n \n 376\n 00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.790\n Teun Hilte: We could also just think of it sorry sorry brandon just to finish.\n \n 377\n 00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:44.310\n Teun Hilte: My thought, but we could also just think of it as a community that we that we.\n \n 378\n 00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:53.760\n Teun Hilte: That we reach out to about new adventures, so that you know you just sign up to become part of the Community, and all that that means is that you.\n \n 379\n 00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:57.900\n Teun Hilte: You will be notified when we do new events will.\n \n 380\n 00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:06.360\n Teun Hilte: send you updates on you have access to certain content but youre not necessarily expected to like be interacting with other people.\n \n 381\n 00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:10.500\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): me wonder whether this doesnt mean.\n \n 382\n 00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:15.480\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): yeah I think part of that is is a kind of a programming.\n \n 383\n 00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:24.780\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): question that needs to be worked out later, but I think right now we already have this Community thats buried and we just reach out to every now and then.\n \n 384\n 00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:33.840\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): Keeping that Community engaged, I think we need have a space for them to engage engage one another engage other content that were creating.\n \n 385\n 00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:35.970\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): I think that you know.\n \n 386\n 00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:47.010\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): Just randomly reaching out and we were keeping a database and air table, but we need to create value for this Community to be part of it and thats right thing we need to have a programming discussion about.\n \n 387\n 00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:59.580\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): What does the Community do whats the value proposition were providing for each of those segments of that community, including new partners and existing partners, you know speakers and and others.\n \n 388\n 00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:12.420\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): Well, I think, from the platform perspective or from the product perspective, we need to create a space for that engagement.\n \n 389\n 00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:19.500\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): In addition to the conversation space where we in engage conversation.\n \n 390\n 00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:30.450\n Amar Bakshi: If you know if you think of an analog that might be useful its you know all these platforms that enable creators to.\n \n 391\n 00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:41.550\n Amar Bakshi: craft a class or to craft their own show right but they all tend to be isolated creators with their own audiences that they see to monetize or whatever.\n \n 392\n 00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:52.320\n Amar Bakshi: What were kind of describing as a creator community that may be present on its own, but also maybe couples in interesting ways to create new.\n \n 393\n 00:45:52.920 --> 00:46:06.480\n Amar Bakshi: For you know new new insight new expertise, so they dont just come in with one story right and that might thats a little bit distinct and the consumers, the people who come in to watch.\n \n 394\n 00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:15.990\n Amar Bakshi: or engage not many of them become creators, you know and its not critical at this point that they that we even create that pathway low you might want to think about it down the line.\n \n 395\n 00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:26.130\n Amar Bakshi: But I think what is important is that these creators are actually they are networked together and able to more dynamically forum conversational content series.\n \n 396\n 00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:38.610\n Amar Bakshi: Then, just like you know this is Louis alone talking about mass incarceration well no not quite that could be something, but so to could Lewis and and someone else talking in Afghanistan about.\n \n 397\n 00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:47.790\n Amar Bakshi: Reducing gang violence so im just thinking structurally like you know whats the analog and hows it a little different than the animal.\n \n 398\n 00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.040\n Danara Sarioglu: And the analog im actually.\n \n 399\n 00:46:50.760 --> 00:47:02.760\n Danara Sarioglu: im actually thinking of YouTube now that you talked about the satellite because we are creators, we have commenters but also the creators company commenters as well, as you know, conscious going to creators and.\n \n 400\n 00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:07.500\n Danara Sarioglu: yeah and they actually YouTube has a community as well the creators so.\n \n 401\n 00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:13.920\n Amar Bakshi: yeah interesting yeah and itd be interesting to know how you can mix and match those creators can, how do they co create.\n \n 402\n 00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:19.410\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): yeah because I eventually see like what youre describing them are is.\n \n 403\n 00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:28.830\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): Eventually, not only are the creators finding more creators for a conversation but theyre potentially creating programming for conversation.\n \n 404\n 00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.190\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): By linking up with one another.\n \n 405\n 00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:35.850\n Brent Marcus: God.\n \n 406\n 00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:38.970\n Brent Marcus: tones example of clubhouse which I did spend some time on.\n \n 407\n 00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:41.070\n Brent Marcus: earlier in the year.\n \n 408\n 00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:54.780\n Brent Marcus: So dynamic okay like shirts, you have a group I dont know who else has been on there so like we could run a group, basically, I think they call it, I dont remember if its a group I forget what they call it, but.\n \n 409\n 00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:17.400\n Brent Marcus: And then you can you use schedule, you can say were having a conversation on X and were going to run it shared studios but at the same time, because youve got a group there centric you can also say Okay, if you can give the ability for the members of your group to also start conversations.\n \n 410\n 00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:24.930\n Brent Marcus: Again its a very living thing so so actually I mean I really yeah when Tony mentioned that it really resonated.\n \n 411\n 00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:33.660\n Brent Marcus: bars that I mean its outside that exact examples outside of ours, but its still you know shared studios.\n \n 412\n 00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:36.420\n Brent Marcus: group so.\n \n 413\n 00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:38.550\n thats yeah how.\n \n 414\n 00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:47.190\n Danara Sarioglu: Should we, I would suggest to like take that conversation to another.\n \n 415\n 00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:49.410\n Danara Sarioglu: Meeting or.\n \n 416\n 00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:59.760\n Danara Sarioglu: Another to do so, as regards that may be creating a like definitions of like our Community network and maybe like create a.\n \n 417\n 00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.400\n Danara Sarioglu: figure or something like visual as well.\n \n 418\n 00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:07.680\n Danara Sarioglu: In the future.\n \n 419\n 00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.720\n Shankar Jagannathan: I think so suggestion brendas keep a.\n \n 420\n 00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:29.070\n Shankar Jagannathan: backup slide going on table questions to be explored in depth, because im seeing a lot of the discussion here is more on the programming and Community side right, how do we enrich that community, how do we create engaging.\n \n 421\n 00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:42.000\n Shankar Jagannathan: sticky conversations and content with them, those are I dont think still very im not saying it that germane to a product discussion, I think it is germane to the business model for sure.\n \n 422\n 00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:54.060\n Shankar Jagannathan: But I think its think of it as more of the product was a service inside of the business, maybe not as well, and this these these discussions into the model service inside.\n \n 423\n 00:49:55.920 --> 00:50:04.020\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): I agree, and im keeping some some notes on this as well shanker just thinking about what a workshop like this might look like for that service is.\n \n 424\n 00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:05.580\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): resigning creation.\n \n 425\n 00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:14.460\n Shankar Jagannathan: And I think that workshops for them Jay and they can others who are engaging with the Community know you know where do people drop off right.\n \n 426\n 00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:24.930\n Shankar Jagannathan: So I think its a different set of questions, so I just want to make sure we dont bleed over into into a set of question that may not be germane here.\n \n 427\n 00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:34.950\n Shankar Jagannathan: But I think whats coming out from this Community engagement which many of you guys have pointed again and again, is that there needs to be some content spaces to engage around.\n \n 428\n 00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:43.140\n Shankar Jagannathan: Right, not just repositories but some actively curated spaces, that we do help create or maintain it looks like.\n \n 429\n 00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:51.390\n Shankar Jagannathan: rank where are we going.\n \n 430\n 00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:56.850\n Danara Sarioglu: yeah that is already a feature that you listed similarities there.\n \n 431\n 00:50:57.090 --> 00:50:58.350\n Brent Marcus: Well, I mean.\n \n 432\n 00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:06.600\n Brent Marcus: I mean a little just joined it, I think, but lets lets talk about the virtual event side and then.\n \n 433\n 00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:19.650\n Brent Marcus: This next slide after that is the Brit this was intended as the bridge so weve kind of done some of this definition stuff but then more from an analytics lens, so I think we should yeah lets.\n \n 434\n 00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:21.810\n Brent Marcus: Go ahead and then.\n \n 435\n 00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:26.520\n Shankar Jagannathan: Just to give some guidance to dawn and you and I dont.\n \n 436\n 00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:30.120\n Danara Sarioglu: Know surprised by the way, he said that he stepped away, you might not be here so.\n \n 437\n 00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:32.130\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): yeah I think he had to go to the bathroom.\n \n 438\n 00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:33.840\n Brent Marcus: So okay.\n \n 439\n 00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:49.260\n Shankar Jagannathan: I was going to suggest to him to skip it, or at least just pull out the lessons learned versus a you know didnt even show up as a focus in our customer segments 14 earlier and I know he agrees with that too so lets not focus too much on live events and go to the conversation.\n \n 440\n 00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:54.600\n Shankar Jagannathan: Quality and what accommodation means that were going next right.\n \n 441\n 00:51:56.550 --> 00:52:04.980\n Brent Marcus: yeah yeah yeah my one comment here just looking at competitors and the language you know ive mentioned this, the multiple from hybrid comes up.\n \n 442\n 00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:13.920\n Brent Marcus: So the question is, you know some of that were putting on were doing a conversation, what happens if you know our customer wants 1000 people to view it.\n \n 443\n 00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:23.760\n Brent Marcus: So theres some linkage that that we can do with none of the segments of this content now its already developed thats thats the beautiful part like.\n \n 444\n 00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:35.880\n Brent Marcus: We may do a few things to kind of roll it in but thats kind of my take on it, I think its invaluable that weve done it and it could come up and its kind of there you know to me.\n \n 445\n 00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:49.920\n Shankar Jagannathan: So, in the context of a conversation brand youre saying we might have to Naples, the scale, who have dreamed or larger population yeah.\n \n 446\n 00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:52.200\n Brent Marcus: The competitors call that hybrid so.\n \n 447\n 00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:54.720\n Brent Marcus: theres some physical yeah.\n \n 448\n 00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:55.890\n Shankar Jagannathan: thats a good point.\n \n 449\n 00:52:56.070 --> 00:53:00.120\n Brent Marcus: yeah we kind of covered your side, a bit do you want to just make a few comments and then.\n \n 450\n 00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:08.820\n Teun Hilte: I well I am I just wanted to add here that I think.\n \n 451\n 00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:18.090\n Teun Hilte: This is somewhat you know removed from what weve been talking about so far, I mean this, this is, this is not so much.\n \n 452\n 00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:27.420\n Teun Hilte: You know this serve the need, I think, at a at a at a specific point in time.\n \n 453\n 00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:30.090\n Teun Hilte: And it may well be.\n \n 454\n 00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.920\n Teun Hilte: A demand for for some of this going forward, but I think.\n \n 455\n 00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:39.990\n Teun Hilte: I personally dont see that as a core.\n \n 456\n 00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:52.710\n Teun Hilte: target market right like weve learned a lot from it, I think, in our own team and CRM and you know weve weve seen what works which is anything that allows people to engage.\n \n 457\n 00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:53.220\n Shankar Jagannathan: As if.\n \n 458\n 00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:57.210\n Teun Hilte: As if theyre theyre like next like the mo geez.\n \n 459\n 00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:00.870\n Teun Hilte: social media integration, I think, was.\n \n 460\n 00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:14.790\n Teun Hilte: So, so not not the most successful, I think, by far the live messaging and the mo geez were were most successful the knowledge unfinished you have any further thoughts on that, but.\n \n 461\n 00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:20.730\n Teun Hilte: The ability to live streaming event, I think, in itself, is is important.\n \n 462\n 00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:24.660\n Teun Hilte: For our platform and our offering.\n \n 463\n 00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:32.460\n Teun Hilte: You know even perhaps for us to be able to live stream portal conversations, to make them available to a wider audience but.\n \n 464\n 00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:41.940\n Teun Hilte: But as a, you know as a product, I think this is not that close to the idea of.\n \n 465\n 00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:53.610\n Teun Hilte: You know conversations transformative conversations that we started with because theyre there one there one way conversations right, so one for many rather than.\n \n 466\n 00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:56.220\n Teun Hilte: interactive conversation.\n \n 467\n 00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:00.300\n Teun Hilte: So what I think we can learn lessons.\n \n 468\n 00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:02.490\n Teun Hilte: I dont think.\n \n 469\n 00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.780\n Shankar Jagannathan: You know.\n \n 470\n 00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:04.110\n Teun Hilte: As a.\n \n 471\n 00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:10.800\n Shankar Jagannathan: As a product its I think I think there are aligned john so thats a I think its a it was a good point in time, I think that.\n \n 472\n 00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:27.540\n Shankar Jagannathan: Lessons rain brought up a good point that they may be, hybrid conversation slash streaming capabilities needed, not necessarily just pure pure streaming so lets take take that take away and then lets move on to conversations now and what that implies.\n \n 473\n 00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:34.590\n Brent Marcus: Okay, so this slide again kind of.\n \n 474\n 00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.260\n Brent Marcus: This this this.\n \n 475\n 00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:39.630\n Brent Marcus: workshop is had its own flow but.\n \n 476\n 00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:48.060\n Brent Marcus: The idea here was to cross connect and kind of start on which weve covered a lot, and obviously we went more into Community the definition part.\n \n 477\n 00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:57.090\n Brent Marcus: But get into where you know, we believe that the critics and its not just believe I mean I know Sean car and team has.\n \n 478\n 00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:01.920\n Brent Marcus: been in the field, as far as the demand is.\n \n 479\n 00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:09.330\n Brent Marcus: You know quantify what were doing and we kind of talked about that up front, so the part of a here is just.\n \n 480\n 00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:17.460\n Brent Marcus: Again, the the definition the language are using so and then im kind of through this but.\n \n 481\n 00:56:18.930 --> 00:56:22.920\n Brent Marcus: ill just start throwing this out there, we see where we go when we get with this on the left side starting.\n \n 482\n 00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:25.680\n Brent Marcus: So we talked in terms of.\n \n 483\n 00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:33.930\n Brent Marcus: I think theres three things I see is like theres a convert is it a conversation then theres a conversation series.\n \n 484\n 00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:43.230\n Brent Marcus: But then we use the term engagement is that is that the same as conversation or is that just manifestation in the platform so.\n \n 485\n 00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:53.220\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): I mean, I think it.\n \n 486\n 00:56:54.240 --> 00:57:08.880\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): If we return to what weve weve gravitated towards as we move through this workshop a conversation is not an engagement, I would have a one time conversation a series of conversations that programmatically have different or similar goal.\n \n 487\n 00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:13.590\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): That can be taken up later and then.\n \n 488\n 00:57:15.210 --> 00:57:16.140\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): I dont know is there.\n \n 489\n 00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.530\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): You know I guess theyre the one time.\n \n 490\n 00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:23.970\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): I guess, this is where the portal and and.\n \n 491\n 00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:34.020\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): transformative conversation may like what is that I think we have to define to the portal what is that immersive experience of the just stepping in and talking for a few minutes with someone else, or we.\n \n 492\n 00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:42.360\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): Programming the portal in such a way that is a conversation always and I dont know nows the time to do that, but I think that just informed.\n \n 493\n 00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:47.160\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): I dont know any other thoughts on on this.\n \n 494\n 00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:48.960\n Danara Sarioglu: For.\n \n 495\n 00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:50.700\n Brent Marcus: You good.\n \n 496\n 00:57:51.540 --> 00:58:02.820\n Danara Sarioglu: For me, the okay so theres conversation series of conversations live events that like are actually interactive and theres like one off conversation goes interactive live event.\n \n 497\n 00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:12.240\n Danara Sarioglu: But also the engagement, would it be kind of like the conversation around like outside of the events or what like when you use the word engagement.\n \n 498\n 00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:27.300\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): thats really interesting dinner because engagement is our this is this part of analytics for us to engage the way in to figure out the way people engage one another in the Community space as we think about that.\n \n 499\n 00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:38.220\n Danara Sarioglu: Yes, I mean its not for analytics its more like to understand again its going back to the Community part, I guess, in a way that.\n \n 500\n 00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:47.460\n Danara Sarioglu: What do we expect to give to our community that theyre going to have that one off conversations that those are the conversations we had were going to have series of conversations, but also.\n \n 501\n 00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:56.550\n Danara Sarioglu: There is there, like when we say word engagement is it also, as you said, a way to give them a way to engage with each other.\n \n 502\n 00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:59.460\n Danara Sarioglu: The gauge with the content.\n \n 503\n 00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:10.380\n Danara Sarioglu: You know, like we can quantify maybe how many times they engage with our content, how many times they downloaded this file or viewed this with legal analysis.\n \n 504\n 00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:14.520\n Danara Sarioglu: Just about.\n \n 505\n 00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:18.420\n Brent Marcus: yeah I think its um.\n \n 506\n 00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:27.060\n Brent Marcus: If theres two things going on here and we have to start without the tech side the the discussion is.\n \n 507\n 00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:36.480\n Brent Marcus: When you say, this is a transformative conversation, it was great you know what what does that mean, because what we want to do is understand that.\n \n 508\n 00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:46.260\n Brent Marcus: breakdown or definition, then that will be the compliment, so I think theres more multiple components on the analytics which is this whole list, which is.\n \n 509\n 00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:54.150\n Brent Marcus: Yes, the okay lets say the zoom part like like Okay, first of all, I feel like were having a great conversation Okay, but.\n \n 510\n 00:59:54.960 --> 01:00:02.460\n Brent Marcus: But what what does that mean today right on this thing okay and and actually what were getting to is that theres a score so we want you know.\n \n 511\n 01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:11.070\n Brent Marcus: In I know mar had a you know customer mentioned this or potential, which is that something valuable to them how do they know that they should you know.\n \n 512\n 01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:20.130\n Brent Marcus: engage with us, you know contract with us to run a conversation, and we can give them this number okay im going to skip ahead just for visual.\n \n 513\n 01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:24.930\n Brent Marcus: Oh here lets say.\n \n 514\n 01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:35.940\n Brent Marcus: Just you know, an artist, I feel like ours is 90 something right like this conversation is rated disengagement this just this piece of this conversation is rated you know 95.\n \n 515\n 01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:42.330\n Brent Marcus: Okay, this was a great you know conversation like, how do we like, how do we, I mean this is a challenge im not saying its easy.\n \n 516\n 01:00:42.810 --> 01:00:50.820\n Brent Marcus: But I think what we have to get back to what how you, you know the experience you have in this part how that breaks down now.\n \n 517\n 01:00:51.570 --> 01:01:09.570\n Brent Marcus: This piece that goes into a little bit what youre saying is well, we can give it a conversation series or a or a a not just a point in time, but the overall time and say okay theres metrics for before the event like you know how do we do about bringing in your whole community and.\n \n 518\n 01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:16.320\n Brent Marcus: Then the live event we kind of talked about, and then post, you know are people still conversing about this, after so.\n \n 519\n 01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.350\n Brent Marcus: But I think I want to back up.\n \n 520\n 01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:31.170\n Brent Marcus: And then just get to how do we know that were having a good conversation because thatll help us figure out how these all these numbers that are available to us turn it.\n \n 521\n 01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:33.870\n Over im.\n \n 522\n 01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:37.950\n Teun Hilte: Sorry, I was just gonna ask brandon.\n \n 523\n 01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:38.280\n What.\n \n 524\n 01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:40.980\n Teun Hilte: What would you say.\n \n 525\n 01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:52.770\n Teun Hilte: makes like what made the recent debates conversation a great one what made the leadership conversation with Jennifer a great conversation today just to that very briefly.\n \n 526\n 01:01:53.580 --> 01:02:06.150\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): At yeah this is that there are some concrete things, but the challenge here is that a lot of it is effective right its its like the feeling that you get and thats thats something weve always had trouble.\n \n 527\n 01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:16.200\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): quantifying in the portal, as well as is how do we, how do we communicate that that feeling I think one of the things thats easily measurable is.\n \n 528\n 01:02:16.830 --> 01:02:20.760\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): audience participation or desperate dissipation how active Are they in the chat.\n \n 529\n 01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:30.810\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): And so, some of this stuff on the side of how many people can go up how many people be how many people are engaging in the chat I think thats a real, concrete way of measuring.\n \n 530\n 01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:49.350\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): And its an indicator to me that the conversation is going really well when people are clearly engaged and wants to be actively a part of it um I think the other things are more difficult to measure and has to do with you know, the way the guests interact with one another.\n \n 531\n 01:02:51.810 --> 01:03:01.920\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): You know that the way the guests themselves communicate the way that is its moderated and those things, I think, are more difficult to measure.\n \n 532\n 01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:16.920\n Shared Studios: What about what about social media monitoring tweeter monitoring for hashtags but want to speak out pull up on those things so maybe Twitter monitoring Facebook, whatever.\n \n 533\n 01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:24.930\n Shared Studios: So, give us a good sentiment analysis paired with we have a lot of advancements and sentiment analysis for.\n \n 534\n 01:03:25.770 --> 01:03:40.440\n Shared Studios: sentences and for posts, so we can have a pretty good assessment on the analytics of a meeting so people will say hey having a great conversation you hashtag after hashtag my super event.\n \n 535\n 01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:52.920\n Shared Studios: And im going to say hey this is boring I dont like this are going to have negative effect, and this is mature technology is not emerging, so we have sentiment analysis pretty rock solid looky Loos that.\n \n 536\n 01:03:55.080 --> 01:04:07.200\n Shared Studios: You can incentivize people to use a hashtag live every program even even TV every TV program has a hashtag and say hey speak your mind hashtag debate 2020 debate I dont know what.\n \n 537\n 01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:19.560\n Shared Studios: And theyre going to collect a lot of deal with that you think that its innocent to put a hashtag but oh God their data mining like crazy and Twitter data mining is pretty cheap so.\n \n 538\n 01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:26.550\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): That thats really thats really interesting to me on this idea of sentiment analysis.\n \n 539\n 01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:32.880\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): Because I am from the product perspective, then its part of what were doing a part of what were.\n \n 540\n 01:04:34.110 --> 01:04:46.560\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): Doing is measuring the the sharing with the hashtag, then we have to, and I think we have this new platform already, but we have to enable people to to create those posts, so that we can ultimately mind that for data.\n \n 541\n 01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:53.130\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): And we have to find ways in the conversation itself to to encourage that.\n \n 542\n 01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:55.440\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): That sharing.\n \n 543\n 01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:06.210\n Shared Studios: Now you can even put sentiment analysis on the chat channels and have one I dont know what the US might that be, I mean we can see.\n \n 544\n 01:05:06.450 --> 01:05:14.520\n Shared Studios: The color of the conversation or the mood of the conversation with people are talking like heartedly or theyre getting into very.\n \n 545\n 01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:26.220\n Shared Studios: polarizing arguments like politics, religion and stuff so yeah my my greatest ally on an alarm to the moderator to say hey this is gonna this is heating up.\n \n 546\n 01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:31.830\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): thats interesting like being able to kind of measure some of that within the chat.\n \n 547\n 01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:33.840\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): In the conversation real time itself.\n \n 548\n 01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:45.960\n Shared Studios: Absolutely each each chat channel will have a a mood score so you would know if people are talking things about racism or if its all happiness and everythings.\n \n 549\n 01:05:46.500 --> 01:06:00.660\n Shared Studios: really happy or theres somebody specially some people someone specific who is very, very negative and you can just call him private and say hey im going to have to kick you dont change that or something.\n \n 550\n 01:06:06.450 --> 01:06:10.920\n Danara Sarioglu: Well yeah I think I remember you talked about like two different.\n \n 551\n 01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:23.880\n Danara Sarioglu: Measurements here, where one is really like the Twitter and social media its more like what is perceived by the participants this conversation, and the other one would help.\n \n 552\n 01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:40.080\n Danara Sarioglu: us as a company, what do we define as transparent like that would help to that metric I think what is a transformative conversation, or what is successful conversation, because the social media one is really subjective and were trying to find like an objective successful.\n \n 553\n 01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:41.730\n Danara Sarioglu: terminating we also.\n \n 554\n 01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:44.010\n Danara Sarioglu: get into the I guess into that but.\n \n 555\n 01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:55.710\n Shared Studios: The district and principle, the principle of data mining is that you dont distinguish data you just collected and then you let artificial models tell you results like.\n \n 556\n 01:06:56.580 --> 01:07:04.050\n Shared Studios: You can collect from Twitter you dont get it you dont specify that as an absolute truth, but if you have 1000 hashtags.\n \n 557\n 01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:21.510\n Shared Studios: From people and those 1000 and like 900 of those are saying negative things like its boring or stuff, then you should take that into consideration its pretty good mass and regarding the internal chat is the same technology is just sentiment analysis we just.\n \n 558\n 01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:36.930\n Shared Studios: get a feeling of whats going on in the medical it as you see fit, but its done our says hey I want to have a chat channels here that I want to detect when this doesnt matter, but this is the same technology.\n \n 559\n 01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:49.770\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): im wondering here because I think one of the ways we defined a transformative conversation is impact, and I know that weve had partners do say we moderate conversations for impact.\n \n 560\n 01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:56.670\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): So what im wondering what are ways that we might be able to measure.\n \n 561\n 01:07:58.470 --> 01:08:01.380\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): measure that impact that change or.\n \n 562\n 01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:11.640\n Brent Marcus: A one one thing its pulling or serving afterwards, if I dont think and construct I mean if thats tedious or not to construct that and.\n \n 563\n 01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:18.870\n Brent Marcus: To imply it, you know get that derive from that but thats one thing on the list, we can we can pull in as.\n \n 564\n 01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:30.690\n Danara Sarioglu: yeah we didnt like at the beginning of the conversation create a quick poll of what do you think about the subject that were going to be discussing and then we will create like ask them to.\n \n 565\n 01:08:31.710 --> 01:08:36.930\n Danara Sarioglu: fill that in again and that and show how much space wait for ideas changed.\n \n 566\n 01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:45.720\n Amar Bakshi: That, I think thats really interesting because if you have pre surveys post surveys and you know, the purpose of the conversation.\n \n 567\n 01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:58.740\n Amar Bakshi: Different types of conversations have different purposes, some might be to you know build empathy and break people out of their habituated ways of seeing it can be tighter about that, but its like I opening is what we want kids to experience.\n \n 568\n 01:09:00.330 --> 01:09:03.570\n Amar Bakshi: And there should be effects and how they see the world.\n \n 569\n 01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:16.350\n Amar Bakshi: Pre and post ideally post conversation of series, but there might be other conversations that are really about retention, you know, like how much how much of the what really mattered was retained.\n \n 570\n 01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:26.130\n Amar Bakshi: And so maybe theres a way to you know do some hard data collection on the endpoints and then do some of what Rodrigo is describing in the middle.\n \n 571\n 01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:41.730\n Amar Bakshi: Meeting, what is it about the conversations, if you I dont know what volume, we need here, but what is it about the conversations that made some more eye opening than others can can you know can machines uncover something we couldnt you know.\n \n 572\n 01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:42.840\n Shared Studios: Oh absolutely.\n \n 573\n 01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:44.220\n Shared Studios: thats thats always true.\n \n 574\n 01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:45.270\n Shared Studios: right as.\n \n 575\n 01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:51.300\n Amar Bakshi: Always women speak more you know, is more likely to have written I dont know you know who knows what its going to be.\n \n 576\n 01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:58.860\n Amar Bakshi: But I think thats an interesting challenge, because then we can say like we are studying what makes the conversation transformative to achieve.\n \n 577\n 01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:09.600\n Amar Bakshi: Deeper belonging deeper insight opening up minds collaboration, obviously, over time, and probably with enough scale and that stuff I dont know enough, you know.\n \n 578\n 01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:10.800\n Amar Bakshi: yeah, we need to.\n \n 579\n 01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:21.900\n Shared Studios: You know what the what the best thing is about this its low hanging fruits so mature that its really easy to implement, you can do in one day youre just using services from the phone.\n \n 580\n 01:10:22.530 --> 01:10:31.470\n Shared Studios: And by the way, you asked how much data is enough, the answer is always always always always as much as you can always.\n \n 581\n 01:10:32.250 --> 01:10:33.510\n Shared Studios: So if youre in a selected.\n \n 582\n 01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:38.520\n Shared Studios: collected always yeah never need more inputs always.\n \n 583\n 01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:50.070\n Shankar Jagannathan: I had a thought, maybe this for you brandon to put a little pin on on it and explore, I think I think at a.\n \n 584\n 01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:56.100\n Shankar Jagannathan: At a company level, we need to break down what this week, what are the transformative conversation.\n \n 585\n 01:10:56.790 --> 01:11:05.910\n Shankar Jagannathan: Either point in time or as an engagement, I think that to dimension right can I have one good conversation for a bad outcome in general to, or vice versa, you know you could have one bad.\n \n 586\n 01:11:06.570 --> 01:11:21.420\n Shankar Jagannathan: juniper networks conversation, but overall series of conversations goals, I think we need a thought piece on this and a rubric coming out of it random right now, have you here are the elements of a good conversations like dialogue.\n \n 587\n 01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:31.800\n Shankar Jagannathan: And I like what im going to add if I go back and just to the Scott right maybe a conversation has good focus its always on topic right if I follow word cloud.\n \n 588\n 01:11:32.970 --> 01:11:40.410\n Shankar Jagannathan: Across conversation, the word clouds are always dominated on dni not sports and people wondering.\n \n 589\n 01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:57.060\n Shankar Jagannathan: I think the input, the slash you know, equality, you know back to women versus men talking things like that could be you know, so we need a rubric to break down and say heres all the core dimensions, and this is what we measure right.\n \n 590\n 01:11:58.380 --> 01:11:59.580\n Shankar Jagannathan: Through various ways.\n \n 591\n 01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:16.200\n Shankar Jagannathan: And that will help us really form a very good analytic base to feed back into that top level, you know I thought piece on what we think shared studios makes a good conversation and, by the way, guys we measure to.\n \n 592\n 01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:34.170\n Shankar Jagannathan: thats an amazing value prop in the market to come and say that you know a lot of a lot of platforms will let you have a conversation, but is it a good conversations about their money because I bet you all the conversations we enable the cost is a human cost of people around the table.\n \n 593\n 01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:39.330\n Shankar Jagannathan: Right even look around this table this is half the company around the table theyre spending on time.\n \n 594\n 01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:46.770\n Shankar Jagannathan: And thats the Roi for the company to say, did you measure it, you know that you had a zoom call was it useful.\n \n 595\n 01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:48.720\n Shankar Jagannathan: Right.\n \n 596\n 01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:50.400\n Danara Sarioglu: So.\n \n 597\n 01:12:51.090 --> 01:12:52.020\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): And yeah and I.\n \n 598\n 01:12:52.740 --> 01:13:07.020\n Danara Sarioglu: got to that, I think, like when youre creating that you can always like reach out to us the data that were collecting, but also, you can see this for them that could maybe inspire you to kind of try to define it and give a bit more structured like what do you.\n \n 599\n 01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:10.470\n Danara Sarioglu: Think of your personal experience as a moderator.\n \n 600\n 01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:17.430\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): yeah I mean this is something ive been kind of harping on for a while that we need to define this.\n \n 601\n 01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:34.290\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): And I think I I personally with input from the rest of my team, based on the the events we have and then based on my background I feel comfortable writing what what this is, I think, translating that Junker into some of the stuff youre saying like what are those those elements.\n \n 602\n 01:13:35.370 --> 01:13:36.210\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): And like.\n \n 603\n 01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:38.970\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): Can I can I.\n \n 604\n 01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:46.320\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): translate some of those elements into data, you know things that can be measured.\n \n 605\n 01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:50.160\n Shankar Jagannathan: I think we have a breaking down one step at a time right.\n \n 606\n 01:13:50.340 --> 01:14:02.850\n Shankar Jagannathan: Okay, if we have the next level and transformative can mean a lot of things, but if if we have the next level of what does it mean, and then we can go on to the next level of how would you measure focus, how would you measure.\n \n 607\n 01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:06.090\n Shankar Jagannathan: You know participation.\n \n 608\n 01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.180\n Amar Bakshi: And there might be different kinds of transformative impact.\n \n 609\n 01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:13.290\n Amar Bakshi: Right its not right one kind of transformative impact depends on what youre trying to do.\n \n 610\n 01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:15.180\n Amar Bakshi: Right like.\n \n 611\n 01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:25.980\n Amar Bakshi: Maybe im just throwing this out there, but like a fellowship like Doha theres a theres one kind of goal, you know which is sort of more intimate connections between the people.\n \n 612\n 01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:38.760\n Amar Bakshi: Over time, which is different than a conversation like this, which is very goal oriented around diving deep into a specific set of topics, and so I think also just thinking through what are the goals in the conversations we have.\n \n 613\n 01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:45.300\n Amar Bakshi: With kids talking to ronnie theres a different set of goals you know.\n \n 614\n 01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:56.820\n Shankar Jagannathan: This good and Donald workshop run and just bring our speaker curator Community together and brainstorm this.\n \n 615\n 01:14:58.110 --> 01:15:01.740\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): yeah I think so, and I think you know.\n \n 616\n 01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:09.570\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): Part of part of defining that transformative conversation it coming back to what a marvelous thing about what are the conversation gold is.\n \n 617\n 01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:19.770\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): What does transformative mean in these various in these in these various types of conversations or with or with different types of folks who are involved.\n \n 618\n 01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:31.470\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): Really, for each of our segments, you know, education, what is a transformative conversation and in you know enterprise around diversity and inclusion, etc.\n \n 619\n 01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:51.930\n Brent Marcus: And I think and the main reason I mean I put that up front with the respect of discussion is exactly that, like the ability to focus in and say okay lets just look at this particular customer base.\n \n 620\n 01:15:53.010 --> 01:15:57.210\n Brent Marcus: That and then see how it flows its very specific, I mean, these are all getting real right.\n \n 621\n 01:15:58.800 --> 01:15:59.130\n Amar Bakshi: yeah.\n \n 622\n 01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.390\n Brent Marcus: Just like that.\n \n 623\n 01:16:03.450 --> 01:16:07.800\n Amar Bakshi: I just had one quick random idea throat, and then we can you know I dont need to derail it.\n \n 624\n 01:16:08.370 --> 01:16:20.940\n Amar Bakshi: But you know, like, I was trying to remember what our company values are you know, and I was just thinking, how and I, you know, and I was rereading it us thinking how how important how its hard to know a company value just by reading it.\n \n 625\n 01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:32.370\n Amar Bakshi: Obviously, you have to enact it every day, but one way, I think I would have retained better is if we talk about like what is the value of continuous improvement mean to you and we had a conversation around it.\n \n 626\n 01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:40.890\n Amar Bakshi: And so its like I can see that being very valuable to any organization thats trying to build a company culture is to host conversations.\n \n 627\n 01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:52.290\n Amar Bakshi: On the themes that matter, and you know unpack it because I think store stories are how we embed this knowledge and you can see, like you know what I mean, and so it just like conversations anything or say anything youre trying to do.\n \n 628\n 01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:58.080\n Amar Bakshi: will do a better this way, and these are things that are really critical the culture of an organization is critical.\n \n 629\n 01:17:00.090 --> 01:17:07.680\n Amar Bakshi: You know so anyway just set this aside aside thought on what it means when its transformative it can just be embedding something or people.\n \n 630\n 01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.160\n Shankar Jagannathan: Just to take a pulse check right.\n \n 631\n 01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:19.110\n Shankar Jagannathan: Given theres a product organization do people around this table believe or I strongly believe.\n \n 632\n 01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:31.050\n Shankar Jagannathan: That this path of drawing the tread on transmitted conversations and deriving analytics is a good direction for people to think about.\n \n 633\n 01:17:36.270 --> 01:17:39.540\n Shared Studios: I could only answer that like case my personal opinion.\n \n 634\n 01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:52.560\n Shared Studios: You should focus on what gives you money, this is a not a nonprofit organization so well just see what gives the most money in focus.\n \n 635\n 01:17:54.450 --> 01:17:58.260\n Shared Studios: But thats my non business im not a business person.\n \n 636\n 01:18:02.730 --> 01:18:19.470\n Shankar Jagannathan: Okay, if I had to translate your comment that means youre asking the others do we believe that driving this from just an abstract conversation into analytics to backup whether it was a good conversation the bullet make money in the market.\n \n 637\n 01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:35.310\n Danara Sarioglu: I have my response to that as well, like so or at least like going back to the first lights right to where we talked about the purpose the engagement, the Community im not engagement rate, the purpose the.\n \n 638\n 01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:49.080\n Danara Sarioglu: segments and value proposition and also the what is Community it seems like the transformative Community communication has been what weve been talking about right and.\n \n 639\n 01:18:49.770 --> 01:19:01.980\n Danara Sarioglu: But we also have talked about Community as well, so we need to also add that against what like, how can we also measure that the engagement of the whole community itself as well, it seems like we went there as well.\n \n 640\n 01:19:03.690 --> 01:19:04.470\n Danara Sarioglu: But.\n \n 641\n 01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:12.000\n Danara Sarioglu: yeah I think if this is our purpose and its This is our value proposition for the segments.\n \n 642\n 01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:30.180\n Danara Sarioglu: Then, that is going to make us money um basically if thats what those segments required for example for corporate learning if diversity equity inclusion is the topic is that its what we are doing in the conversation, then we need to kind of give them a level like.\n \n 643\n 01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:45.120\n Danara Sarioglu: metric metrics of hey this was a success hey this were a lot of people engaged people left with feeling good, and this was a successful conversation for you so youll see the results in your company in later in the month or something I dont know.\n \n 644\n 01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:51.870\n Danara Sarioglu: But I think that is valuable and that would be thats why they would invest in US or give us money because.\n \n 645\n 01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:56.160\n Teun Hilte: I think.\n \n 646\n 01:19:58.050 --> 01:19:58.440\n Teun Hilte: You know.\n \n 647\n 01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:03.210\n Teun Hilte: to your point where we go in the past.\n \n 648\n 01:20:04.830 --> 01:20:06.840\n Teun Hilte: Companies or institutions given us money.\n \n 649\n 01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:16.890\n Teun Hilte: Essentially, to sponsor a portal to bring a portal to that community to their organization right in order to give them access to the network to the experience, etc.\n \n 650\n 01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:30.420\n Teun Hilte: I think what we need to move towards this is very clear deliverables what is our statement of work lets look like right like we if we can like like that are saying, if we can think we can deliver on.\n \n 651\n 01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:31.950\n Teun Hilte: Whatever.\n \n 652\n 01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:38.490\n Teun Hilte: An engagement score of X or whatever the deliverable might be, then, then we have.\n \n 653\n 01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:43.440\n Teun Hilte: A measurable outcome that we can charge.\n \n 654\n 01:20:45.570 --> 01:20:54.000\n Teun Hilte: I think, in the past its been its been tricky that weve promised certain outcomes that are sort of random difficult to measure as a part of a.\n \n 655\n 01:20:54.660 --> 01:21:10.800\n Teun Hilte: portal activation and then maybe the the expectations have been different, or it hasnt been full alignment on what that looks like and as the activation were on the client started to sort of asked about how we can do things different etc, I think we need to learn from that.\n \n 656\n 01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:19.470\n Teun Hilte: and apply very clear deliverables or you know outcomes to do that, you really.\n \n 657\n 01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:21.480\n Shared Studios: I agree with you that.\n \n 658\n 01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:23.940\n Shared Studios: That reinforces the idea that.\n \n 659\n 01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:29.820\n Shared Studios: We are a technology company, after all, that that human.\n \n 660\n 01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:39.690\n Shared Studios: heart warm stuff that just exists behind it, it has its a startup or a company that has data needs to work with.\n \n 661\n 01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:48.330\n Danara Sarioglu: You and also, I think one more thing sorry for my my chin can stop me if im.\n \n 662\n 01:21:48.810 --> 01:21:57.960\n Danara Sarioglu: wrong, but if this is all the assumption is that its a B2B business like its where its not.\n \n 663\n 01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:11.850\n Danara Sarioglu: So here were talking about segments as corporates or schools, but we before again in Community conversation were talking about how the content consumers might become the content creators and the content creators themselves.\n \n 664\n 01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:29.460\n Danara Sarioglu: Are they also customers as well you know what I mean like do we want to generate value from there as well give them like can we get some income from there as well, but thats kind of a subscription model thats a different conversation so that also to be here thanks.\n \n 665\n 01:22:34.770 --> 01:22:43.620\n Shankar Jagannathan: One analogy, I like I said I like analogies so that it simplifies that thinking, one that comes to mind, for me, and maybe not be spot on but somewhat.\n \n 666\n 01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:53.970\n Shankar Jagannathan: Is marketing the science and field of marketing it used to be an art back in the day was that you didnt know why someone came to your site or bought something.\n \n 667\n 01:22:54.450 --> 01:23:01.470\n Shankar Jagannathan: In all, you did was try to make the funnel as big as possible, so you know you lost some along the way, and then you gained at the bottom.\n \n 668\n 01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:11.040\n Shankar Jagannathan: It has become such a science, because people are broken down exactly how to measure what youre doing into some intact right thats what the marketers and.\n \n 669\n 01:23:11.610 --> 01:23:15.600\n Shankar Jagannathan: And hubspot and all do right which is some kind of sentiment analysis.\n \n 670\n 01:23:16.170 --> 01:23:22.800\n Shankar Jagannathan: You know they measured abandoned carts as a way to say it like this and you lost that maybe its the price, maybe the delivery.\n \n 671\n 01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:30.810\n Shankar Jagannathan: I think theyre trying to do the same right were trying to gauge the intent of the person to say that he or she have a good conversation.\n \n 672\n 01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:44.430\n Shankar Jagannathan: Our field is a valuable use of my time into some kind of analytic side so its a its a you know its a its a big goal, but the problem is good go right and bring some science to this field.\n \n 673\n 01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:50.880\n Shankar Jagannathan: Okay, we have another.\n \n 674\n 01:23:50.970 --> 01:23:53.310\n Shankar Jagannathan: exciting yeah thats exactly how it.\n \n 675\n 01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:55.800\n Shared Studios: thats exactly how I see things you.\n \n 676\n 01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:08.100\n Shankar Jagannathan: know and, obviously, people have created a lot of value in on these companies have rocketed as they provided some of this intuition better intuition to guide marketers.\n \n 677\n 01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:17.820\n Shankar Jagannathan: So maybe we can do the same for corporate learning and people are spending money on conversations Okay, so we have 10 minutes.\n \n 678\n 01:24:19.290 --> 01:24:25.140\n Shankar Jagannathan: Maybe we should take stock of it and not nestle force everything today, and maybe our part two.\n \n 679\n 01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:29.400\n Shankar Jagannathan: I think what we learned is.\n \n 680\n 01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:33.300\n Shankar Jagannathan: Community is important.\n \n 681\n 01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:39.330\n Shankar Jagannathan: Well curated well engage community and how you engage them.\n \n 682\n 01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:56.130\n Shankar Jagannathan: How you grow them as important part of that is content right, so we didnt spend much time on that and maybe thats what we need to come back to in another on what is content mean, how do you manage content, how do you make it accessible.\n \n 683\n 01:24:57.780 --> 01:24:58.500\n Shankar Jagannathan: etc.\n \n 684\n 01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:11.160\n Shankar Jagannathan: We also didnt get to the table stakes of what does it take to just deliver the conversation, and I know Rodrigo cm dinner you guys are investigating.\n \n 685\n 01:25:11.670 --> 01:25:21.390\n Shankar Jagannathan: options for us the fastest path to that and that could be a good report out next time to write when you guys come up with a definite of optional how fast, can we go.\n \n 686\n 01:25:23.370 --> 01:25:38.580\n Shankar Jagannathan: That includes conversation, and all the elements of that, but also to the earlier point about maybe a hybrid space right when we may have to have some allow thousand participants may not be active participant, but just audience and things like that.\n \n 687\n 01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:53.250\n Shankar Jagannathan: I think we came on strongly on the asset side on trees in the programming and curation so all of what we do in the product section help feed into that second content and platform does.\n \n 688\n 01:25:54.210 --> 01:26:01.110\n Shankar Jagannathan: And we lean heavily on the corporate learning and education segments right so at least that is getting clearer for us.\n \n 689\n 01:26:01.770 --> 01:26:17.520\n Shankar Jagannathan: In terms of where we are aiming and toms point that live event aspect of the market was good, with some lessons to take away, but not necessarily the Center of our website so hopefully thatll have the part in focus on what that means.\n \n 690\n 01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:23.250\n Shankar Jagannathan: And then on the conversation analytics where we spend the most time I think some of the actions are.\n \n 691\n 01:26:23.790 --> 01:26:28.890\n Shankar Jagannathan: Number one for brandon and team to go away and somehow think about it and break it down for us.\n \n 692\n 01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:41.520\n Shankar Jagannathan: into a thought piece around whats a rubric for a good conversation and come up with even a taxonomy or when we say conversation, been a point in time, or is it the series right and I dont know if we have.\n \n 693\n 01:26:42.810 --> 01:26:49.710\n Shankar Jagannathan: broken through that so a taxonomy and what we have meaning and then rubric on how to measure getting it.\n \n 694\n 01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:52.740\n Shankar Jagannathan: would be a good in parallel.\n \n 695\n 01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:59.010\n Shankar Jagannathan: exercise and then bring it back to the product team on.\n \n 696\n 01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:08.580\n Shankar Jagannathan: What does it mean to develop some good analytics so my heres my suggestion and feel and lets lets dialogue around the next steps number one.\n \n 697\n 01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:15.120\n Shankar Jagannathan: I think the product he needs to think of another workshop to cover those other two topics, the platform table stakes, and the.\n \n 698\n 01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:30.840\n Shankar Jagannathan: And the content management and what that means to brandon think about the workshop around programming and effectiveness of programming, so that you can feed into the product team for the third product session.\n \n 699\n 01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:33.750\n Shankar Jagannathan: and\n \n 700\n 01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:42.360\n Shankar Jagannathan: empower parallel whether you want another programming workshop separate from that or thats aligned with that.\n \n 701\n 01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:45.750\n Shankar Jagannathan: So those are some of the next steps, I see.\n \n 702\n 01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:48.240\n Shankar Jagannathan: thoughts around the table.\n \n 703\n 01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:53.550\n Shankar Jagannathan: What what you felt for a good takeaways and where we need to go next.\n \n 704\n 01:27:57.810 --> 01:27:59.580\n Danara Sarioglu: I think, also if we can add.\n \n 705\n 01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:10.050\n Danara Sarioglu: taxonomy or color was worth like just to define it by keywords and define the when were talking its going to be easier.\n \n 706\n 01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:12.960\n Shankar Jagannathan: yeah taxonomy yeah.\n \n 707\n 01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:19.710\n Teun Hilte: I think.\n \n 708\n 01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:24.600\n Teun Hilte: I think this has been really useful very productive for like crystallizing what.\n \n 709\n 01:28:25.890 --> 01:28:27.930\n Teun Hilte: What whats important thinking what.\n \n 710\n 01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:30.870\n Teun Hilte: You know what our.\n \n 711\n 01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:38.280\n Teun Hilte: key aspects, I do think that we still have, I mean to me anyway its not still not clear.\n \n 712\n 01:28:39.870 --> 01:28:43.290\n Teun Hilte: What that leads to like what the product looks like what the.\n \n 713\n 01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:50.880\n Teun Hilte: thing thats something we need to work on and well see based on the inputs that were getting from the sessions that have been.\n \n 714\n 01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:53.820\n Teun Hilte: brought up today but.\n \n 715\n 01:28:57.150 --> 01:28:59.250\n Teun Hilte: yeah I think its been very useful to crystallize.\n \n 716\n 01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:01.380\n Teun Hilte: What.\n \n 717\n 01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:03.540\n Teun Hilte: what our priorities are.\n \n 718\n 01:29:07.650 --> 01:29:17.010\n Danara Sarioglu: For me, I can start seeing like how the purpose or the vision is starts to trickle down into actual actionable things for the company.\n \n 719\n 01:29:18.030 --> 01:29:23.820\n Danara Sarioglu: Or at least now we know where to, we need to make decisions, and I think we need to dig deeper.\n \n 720\n 01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:32.850\n Danara Sarioglu: which will be in the future, where, how is when we started by defining the Community defining the conversation, and then we can.\n \n 721\n 01:29:33.870 --> 01:29:37.590\n Danara Sarioglu: are good conversation, and I think that will shape the product.\n \n 722\n 01:29:40.530 --> 01:29:45.480\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): yeah I, I want to hold a programming workshops with typically around community.\n \n 723\n 01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:53.880\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): And conversation, to a certain extent amar if I can carve out the time.\n \n 724\n 01:29:55.170 --> 01:30:03.870\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): While weve been talking im already downloading academic articles on dialogue and conversation, because I have access to a lot of journals.\n \n 725\n 01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:10.950\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): And that was a good portion of my dissertation so I feel confident writing an initial like.\n \n 726\n 01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:27.180\n Brandon Ferderer (he/him): This is what we mean by transformative conversation piece, and then just working with with you and and others on this team to to refine that so, then we can move to the next step is Junkers bed and start turning that into you know what are the elements and how do we measure those elements.\n \n 727\n 01:30:30.690 --> 01:30:48.450\n Danara Sarioglu: I have a quick question as well for the purpose or nervous yeah, for I guess where were going with that we, it seems like were going for education corporate learning and wondering if we have data as well to support that like from is it no marketing.\n \n 728\n 01:30:49.890 --> 01:30:53.340\n Danara Sarioglu: That will have income that that that is where the money is.\n \n 729\n 01:30:56.130 --> 01:31:09.450\n Amar Bakshi: weve been doing a lot of market work to try to see which segments are large and which are growing rapidly and E learning as an enormous rapidly growing sector, I think, so I think we have a pretty good sense that theres a good.\n \n 730\n 01:31:11.010 --> 01:31:12.870\n Amar Bakshi: place for us to begin.\n \n 731\n 01:31:14.370 --> 01:31:17.340\n Amar Bakshi: In terms of where within that e learning we focus.\n \n 732\n 01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:20.370\n Amar Bakshi: I think were a little less sure.\n \n 733\n 01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:27.120\n Amar Bakshi: You know dni or sort of more subject specific learning.\n \n 734\n 01:31:28.230 --> 01:31:30.240\n Amar Bakshi: That thats something were still exploring.\n \n 735\n 01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:38.220\n Amar Bakshi: But there theres theres ample data is for that as the you know the beachhead for for this work.\n \n 736\n 01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:49.410\n Amar Bakshi: yeah which region which I, you know when we investor deck is getting rejiggered but, when it, you know we can share some of that when.\n \n 737\n 01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:52.620\n Amar Bakshi: When weve rejected the market sizing.\n \n 738\n 01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:58.680\n Shankar Jagannathan: I think theres some of the rough numbers, we saw more on the corporate learning side its like 6070 billion.\n \n 739\n 01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:00.870\n Amar Bakshi: yeah growing at 15% a year.\n \n 740\n 01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:08.730\n Shankar Jagannathan: Right and if youre narrowing just to the leadership development, which is a smaller segment of that is probably 1520 years yeah yeah yeah.\n \n 741\n 01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:16.440\n Amar Bakshi: And and just learning period corporate learning you learn it, you know its half a trillion dollars something.\n \n 742\n 01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:25.950\n Amar Bakshi: Down also growing incredibly quickly because coven and so forth its a lot of its moving with the E learning so theyre definitely good tailwinds at our back.\n \n 743\n 01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:27.300\n With this.\n \n 744\n 01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:31.710\n Teun Hilte: What I also want to mention is that I think.\n \n 745\n 01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:39.150\n Teun Hilte: We should think of these conversation analytic tools.\n \n 746\n 01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:42.300\n Teun Hilte: Whatever they end up looking like as.\n \n 747\n 01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:51.630\n Teun Hilte: being kind of platform platform agnostic as well, I think we should we should be able to acquire those portal conversations in the future.\n \n 748\n 01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:56.460\n Teun Hilte: As much as two virtual conversations on the journeys platform because.\n \n 749\n 01:32:58.950 --> 01:33:00.450\n Teun Hilte: I feel like thats a port from the.\n \n 750\n 01:33:01.770 --> 01:33:11.250\n Teun Hilte: Improving the experience itself within the portal I think thats That would be a major step to enrich the portal experience for people that we could actually.\n \n 751\n 01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:13.110\n Amar Bakshi: You know.\n \n 752\n 01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:14.430\n Teun Hilte: Provide analytics on.\n \n 753\n 01:33:17.730 --> 01:33:19.230\n Teun Hilte: What those conversations look like.\n \n 754\n 01:33:24.090 --> 01:33:24.390\n yeah.\n \n 755\n 01:33:28.110 --> 01:33:29.700\n Shankar Jagannathan: The other comments.\n \n 756\n 01:33:30.630 --> 01:33:37.530\n Brent Marcus: Well, I mean I know time is up here, but I just want to tie it back to what I said up front, which is you know in support of this and we dont.\n \n 757\n 01:33:38.130 --> 01:33:49.260\n Brent Marcus: You know series of projects that are like these follow ups, you know product team is looking at you know process improvement and quality improvement and getting more agile so, so we will be in position.\n \n 758\n 01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:55.830\n Brent Marcus: To be more effective, is our goal until I see it, thats what some of these other slides are kind of about.\n \n 759\n 01:33:59.550 --> 01:34:00.300\n Shankar Jagannathan: Any thoughts.\n \n 760\n 01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:19.980\n Shankar Jagannathan: On the hour Let me suggest rent and dinner, if you could circulate both the slides, as well as some notes on this, and maybe even a link to the recording.\n \n 761\n 01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:36.270\n Shankar Jagannathan: I would urge everyone to at least read the notes and and comment back what youd like to see in you know, in a subsequent workshop whether its on the product side of the programming side, so we can guide the agenda more precisely so.\n \n 762\n 01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:47.760\n Shankar Jagannathan: Go back to this is the deal that has to get it done right and then no one else doing anything for us, so if we want to have a really successful company and.\n \n 763\n 01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:55.500\n Shankar Jagannathan: The team does invigorated, we need to solve some for some of these questions that we do so.\n \n 764\n 01:34:56.190 --> 01:34:57.240\n Shankar Jagannathan: So, give us some thought.\n \n 765\n 01:34:57.300 --> 01:35:03.030\n Shankar Jagannathan: Once you get the notes and passing back and well schedule, you know, a couple other workshops to push the thinking forward.\n \n 766\n 01:35:04.230 --> 01:35:07.680\n Shared Studios: I have a question its a very good question.\n \n 767\n 01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:16.020\n Shared Studios: But when you say programming youre talking in the context of creating social programs that are done in a meeting right.\n \n 768\n 01:35:17.070 --> 01:35:18.750\n Shared Studios: or like coding itself.\n \n 769\n 01:35:23.670 --> 01:35:24.000\n Shared Studios: Ah.\n \n 770\n 01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:25.290\n Danara Sarioglu: Not coding.\n \n 771\n 01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:26.880\n Shared Studios: Not not coding right.\n \n 772\n 01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:31.560\n Brent Marcus: would be programming right.\n \n 773\n 01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:31.950\n Shared Studios: yeah.\n \n 774\n 01:35:32.910 --> 01:35:36.690\n Shared Studios: thats what I was assuming but just want to make sure.\n \n 775\n 01:35:38.610 --> 01:35:41.610\n Brent Marcus: To say problem is when I started it as being a techie so.\n \n 776\n 01:35:42.060 --> 01:35:42.480\n Shared Studios: Oh.\n \n 777\n 01:35:42.810 --> 01:35:44.880\n Brent Marcus: Not a bad question at all yeah.\n \n 778\n 01:35:46.290 --> 01:35:47.190\n Amar Bakshi: Very important.\n \n 779\n 01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:49.020\n Amar Bakshi: document for us, you know.\n \n 780\n 01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:53.910\n Danara Sarioglu: Definitely, as we grow in different countries as well, its like every word has different means.\n \n 781\n 01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:56.850\n Amar Bakshi: thats translated, I can see that.\n \n 782\n 01:35:57.450 --> 01:36:03.510\n Shared Studios: I used to correctly my head, but yeah just just too much okay thanks.\n \n 783\n 01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:11.760\n Shankar Jagannathan: Very good Thank you everyone for joining and taking real valuable time off your schedules, I know everyones really busy.\n \n 784\n 01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:27.750\n Shankar Jagannathan: Thanks to the product team random dinners, especially for helping prepare for all of this in fall you guys contributing some some thinking on slides and things, so I think we are with certainly further ahead mentally for sure.\n \n 785\n 01:36:29.070 --> 01:36:45.150\n Shankar Jagannathan: But certainly will put it on paper to so increase all of you to push the thinking, especially the product in proactively to come back and say heres what were thinking of the analytics the table stakes platform and content management, next time, so thank you guys.\n \n 786\n 01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:46.860\n Danara Sarioglu: Thank you.\n \n 787\n 01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:48.180\n Shared Studios: Everyone Thank you.\n \n"
